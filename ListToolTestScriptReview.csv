list-ui - ALA skin,"App uses the new ALA skin that has not been used in production. If this app is deployed to prod before the UX/UI project is complete, it will not match the look and feel of the rest of the ALA.",UI, ,Low,to be addressed prior to release of UX designs 
Banner messages,"Code refers to a 'ExternalBanner' component but there appears to be no way of adding a custom banner text on the admin page. Further digging suggests an external JSON file can be referenced via a URL in the config. This needs to be documented so admin can turn on and off - seems the config needs to be set and unset in current implementation. Older ALA apps use the ""admin"" page to do this, so suggesting it is documented on that page.",UI,,Low,
Admin danger zone ,"Has a warning message ""Extremely massive danger zone here. Run these ONLY in development/testing environments."" but its easy to miss. App could easily check the running ENV (dev/test/prod) and simply NOT display this section if PROD deployment.",UI,https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/species-lists/blob/testing/lists-ui/src/views/Admin/index.tsx#L384-L421,Med,resolved
Lists sorting,"Seems to be no way to sort a lists of lists by date or name (only sorting within an individual list). Old lists of lists could be sorted by many fields, including created/updated date.",UI,,High,
My Lists,"Being logged in with my csiro account, I get zero lists when viewing this page. Lists-test shows me 23 lists with same account. Seems its not recognising list ownership from lists migrated from lists-test. Jack confirmed this is a migration issue relating to userId not being provided in the export.",UI,https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/species-lists/pull/227,High,Resolved
Facets for list types ,"It took me a lot of hunting to find this feature - which is hidden in the small button with a ""filter"" icon. Old lists always displayed the facets and I prefer that UX. Old lists app used the label ""Refine lists"", which differs from the new Lists (filter vs refine). This will likely confuse users who are familiar with old app.",UI,,Low-Medium,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
list-service README,"Doesn't mention prerequisites needed to run app. Things like minimum versions of Java and Maven. It seems to be out of date as well, as it quotes the way to run it is: ""./gradlew bootRun"" but app has pom.xml and no gradle config and so it must be a ""mvn"" command. Also doesn't provide doco on what local config files are needed for dev",documentation,https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/species-lists/blob/testing/lists-service/README.md,High,
List search - filters counts are not correct,"Doing a query from home page, then clicking the filters button shows counts for each filter that do not match the count you get when the filter is applied.

List editing issues,"Can't edit an imported/legacy list without having to add a description & licence, that are required fields for new lists but weren't for old lists. User doing edit  may not know the appropriate license type but is forced to add it.

Clarify role of Collectory,"Old list app synced metadata with Collectory - I suspect this is no longer performed, by design but I can't see any mention of it in the README files. ",documentation,,,
Clarify role of Userdetails,Old lists has an admin sync option for updating user attributes between it user table and details in userdetails app. Does the new lists app maintain a similar copy of user attributes or are they transiently pulled from userdetails every time?,documentation,,,
Admin rematch history,Old list shows a history of rematch events in admin section. Missing in new lists app - by design or omission?,feature,,,
Rematch Multiple lists,No rematch option for multiple lists (only all on the admin screen or one on the individual list)  (comment by data team),feature,,,
Util/auth code,"Can the ""src/main/java/au/org/ala/listsapi/util/auth"" be removed, if it is now included in the AUTH library, as per https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-security-project/issues/49 ?",source,https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/species-lists/tree/testing/lists-service/src/main/java/au/org/ala/listsapi/util/auth,,
Home/landing page - heading,"There is no top-level heading for the page, so new users are given no indication what this site does and has to infer it from the content. ",UI,,High,duplicate what is on old lists
Home/landing page - search bar,The search bar is nestled between 2 other widgets used to modify the table/list of entries. This makes it a bit harder to understand what it is. I think the old lists with a dedicated search bar with no other widgets to the left or right is preferable. Search bar should have a dedicated search button (missing) and should be consistent with similar search bars on other ALA tools. Items/page and sort options should be grouped together and visually tied to the results table,UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Home/landing page - results table,"Old Lists tool had many columns to help a user visually determine attributes of a list before opening a given list. New version has minimum attributes (3 vs 9 in old). I think new lists could include a few more attributes, such as creation date and/or modified date. Public could be removed as it seems redundant, as most users can't see non-public lists, apart from their own lists and there is a separate page for that. Also needs to be able to be sorted by some of these attributes and sortable tables are an accepted component type (see sorting  item 14)",UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Pagination,"Clicking to a different page for the results table can seem like nothing has happened, as the content is update but page does not move/change noticeably. View should auto-scroll to the top of the table view when pagination is triggered so user is visually nudged that content has changed",UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Individual list view - filters,"Similar to the home page, the filters should not be hidden, requiring user to know to click a tiny funnel icon. Filters should be displayed and expanded by default, with an option to minimise them to the left. Can be a common component shared with home page.",UI,,Med,to be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Individual list view - list attributes,"List attributes are split into 2 separate groupings - under the title and to the far right of the window. I find this confusing and visually disjointed. I recommend keeping it simpler but grouping all attributes together in one place. Editing metadata is confusing as it is an icon only that is next to the text ""edit fields"" (for the toggle to the left but its not clear this is so).",UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Individual list view - entry details,"In the list view, matched taxa are links to species pages but when viewing the details by clicking on a row, the scientific name is not linked to a species page (it should be linked). Content on the side panel is too vertically spaced out and requires more scrolling than it should. The vertical spacing is greater than other parts of the site and is inconsistent as well.",UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Individual list view - taxon names,Scientific names are not formatted appropriately. E.g. genus names and lower should be in italics. ALA has existing code to detect these so should reuse code and not try to implement from scratch. Note old lists doesn't do it either but should for matched names as we have the rank info to allow it.,UI,,Low,Resolved?  Supplied names are not italicised but scientific names are
Deep linking,"One page application means no obvious URL can be created to go straight to (for example) authoritative, sensitive lists or conservation lists (comment by data team)",UI,,Med,Could be addressed in Phase 2 of lists project?
Pagination,"Need to be able to display more than 40 items, also need option for all lists. Paging is a total pain  (comment by data team)",UI,,Low,could be adressed prior to release of UX designs
Accessibility,"On all pages the descriptive text within search boxes, paging descriptions for number of records and links such as for DR are way too pale. There is not enough contrast, and not meeting accessibility needs. 
This is a problem on so many interfaces (web and mobile), it seems current theme trends are for the paler the better which is very difficult for people with sight impairments and colour delineation problems.
Some hints here:  Color | Accessibility Guidelines.  (comment by data team). After fixing these issues, suggesed that site be tested with one of the Accessibiity checking tools.",UI,,High,to be addressed prior to release of UX designs 
Back button support,"Needs to be supported. Related to deep linking and List sorting, as solution is to use URL state management. E.g. Login, click ""my lists"", click a list to open it, click back button. I expect to see ""my lists"" but I see the default list search result. ",UI,,,
i18n support,"For LA community - touches most of the UI code, so big job. Don't need non-language translations, as LA community will generate these.",UI,,,
Unit tests,"Needed for all public service methods in backend and any pure functions in front end, as an initial goal",source,,,

My Lists filter bug,"Related to item 15. I clicked the ""My lists"" filter while the default search was loading and I can see in the UI that ""My lists"" is ticked but I am still seeing the default list items. Ticking it on and off does not help and I needed to reload the page to fix. I expect that my notes on Row 15: ""Facet for list types"" will resolve this when implemented as required. ",UI,,,
List migration of data,"List migration is failing for non-core fields. E.g. I uploaded a list with the �family� column. I expect that it will be displayed correctly (not �rawfamily�) and it will be recognised as a �supplied core field� (e.g. click on an item in the list, click �show supplied values� toggle in the right hand side dialog. See https://lists.test.ala.org.au/list/67aa6aa4b0475b7b7ae74b8e and https://lists-test.ala.org.au/speciesListItem/list/drt1702260668805 ",,,,
Support legacy URL resolving,"Assuming that the old lists domain will redirect to the new version (so existing links from both internal and external sources continue to resolve), the old UI URL scheme should be supported in a legacy mode, where the old URLs are ""caught"" and redirected to the new pattern, with a lookup process that tries to identify the old dataResourceUid value is converted to the new UUID ID value. E.g. the EPB Clist URL of https://lists.ala.org.au/speciesListItem/list/dr656 is auto-redirected to the new version (using test URL): https://lists.test.ala.org.au/list/67a9a88bb0475b7b7add30bc ",,,,
Removed hard-coded max page number,"Performance testing revealed some deep pagination requests were very slow. A short-term fix was to put a silent, hard limit on the number of pages that could be viewed. Attempting to view pages after 10000 items results in a an empty result set. Example code - RESTController line: https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/species-lists/blob/testing/lists-service/src/main/java/au/org/ala/listsapi/controller/RESTController.java#L249",backend,,,
Upload list UI,"No doco or help to inform user on what format the upload file should ahere to.
Some examples fail to upload, with file that is valid for old lists, if some records contain mostly empty values or non-matching names.
Using taxonID in place of scientificName shoiuld work but fails in new lists",UI,,,
OpenAPI  - show app version number,Needed for testing to ensure correct version is loaded when testing releases,UI,,,
Downloads - S3 links should be configurable,"AWS features should be optional, for LA deployments. Downloads currently redirect to S3 specfic path.",backend,,,
Large downloads seem to fail,"Large downloads can be quite slow to load and with the absence of any progress functionality, the user has no wqay of knowing if it has failed or is running. May need a progress or updsate URL to be sent back, similar to the Biocache download service.",backend,,,
CICD doco,"Need a readme that describes what this is, what it does, how to configure, any manual intervention that is optional or mandatory, where users can find the docker images (because they are not in nexus, this should probably be in the root readme). ",documentation,,,
